# Supply-Chain-Project
In this project, I was looking to identify the discrepancies in the dataset to establish where cost reduction and potential savings can be made. I successfully identified the discrepancies that led to overspend and underspend, the possible causes and a key improvement process. Also, the stakeholders in the improvement process wereidentified.
I cleaned the data and did some feature engineering to help identify the discrepancies and also suggested the possible improvement process to curb over and underspend
